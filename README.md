Experiences with running linux on planet's cosmo communicator. Error Fixes and usable software.
Any additional information and questions are welcome!

## Installation
The linux version I tested include Ubuntu-Touch and Gemian.
The general installation guides can be found here:
1. https://support.planetcom.co.uk/index.php/Linux_for_Cosmo
2. https://github.com/gemian

1. https://devices.ubuntu-touch.io/device/cosmo-communicator/release/xenial/
2. https://github.com/gemian/gemian/wiki/UBPorts

To install UBTouch, you also need to install gemian before.
To find the UBTouch installation files may feel a bit unguided and difficult.
